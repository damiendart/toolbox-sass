toolbox-sass
============

A hodgepodge of web-development-related stuff.

This project currently includes an assortment of JavaScript, PHP, Sass,
and Twig doohickeys and snippets.

The project started off with just the Sass stuff (hence the name) but
has since turned into a general dumping ground for stuff I was regularly
copying-and-pasting between projects. I should probably change the
project name at some point.

I don't recommend using this as-is as I'm prone to making drastic
changes on a whim. Having said that, feel free to have a browse and
pinch stuff for your own projects!
