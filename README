toolbox-sass
============

An assortment of Sass functions, mixins, and variables.

I'm publishing this project online mainly for my own benefit; I got
tired of having to maintain copies of the same bits-and-pieces across
multiple projects. 

I dont't recommend using this for your own projects as-is. I've done a
bunch of customising that you'll probably need to change or undo for
your projects. I'm also prone to making drastic changes on a whim.

Having said that, feel free to have a browse and pinch stuff!
